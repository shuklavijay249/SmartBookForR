<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Java the Programming Language</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Programming languages, like regular languages, are different ways to communicate to a computer how you want it to act. Programming languages allow us to instruct a computer step-by-step how to manipulate data, collect input from users, and display things on a screen, among other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Way down on a microscopic level, the processor of a computer sends electrical signals back and forth that control how it operates.&nbsp;<em>High level</em>&nbsp;programming languages like Java mean that we can write these instructions in an abstract manner using words and symbols, and the computer will take care of translating these instructions that we can understand all the way down to electrical impulses that the processor can understand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not to get ahead of ourselves, but Java is a statically-typed, object-oriented language. Let&rsquo;s break this down:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Statically-typed&rdquo; &ndash; Programming at its core is really about working with data. Pieces of data are stored as variables, which are basically containers that hold data. Statically-typed languages like Java require us to declare what type of data each variable (or container) will hold. So for example, if a variable is supposed to hold a number, we need to say so, and we won&rsquo;t be allowed to put something else like a letter in it. Statically-typed also means that all the variables will be checked before the program even runs, and we&rsquo;ll be presented with an error if we forget to declare a type of data or declare the wrong one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Object-oriented&rdquo; &ndash; An object-oriented language is one that is built around the concept of objects. In the physical world, take a look around the room and think of each thing as an object. For example, on my desk right now I have a mug. As an object, it&rsquo;s name is &ldquo;mug&rdquo; and it has properties about it like its color and how much liquid it will hold. Object-oriented languages allow us to define objects like mugs and access their properties in our code. We can also send messages to objects, so for my mug I might want to know &ldquo;Is it empty?&rdquo; We can then create and manipulate all sorts of objects to do different things in our app. For example, we can use the Camera object to take a photo. The Camera object represents the physical camera on an Android phone, but in a way that we can interact with in code.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Java is Not Related to JavaScript</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my favorite sayings about this topic is &ldquo;Java is to JavaScript as Car is to Carpet.&rdquo; There is absolutely no relationship between the two languages. However, knowing JavaScript can help you understand Java, because some of the basic components and ideas are similar. The two languages are written differently and work very differently, but both allow us to work with programming features like variables, methods, operators, and even objects. And the logic behind the language is the same, so knowing how to use variables, methods (or functions), and loops will make learning Java much easier; at that point you just need to learn the&nbsp;<em>syntax</em>&nbsp;of Java, which is how you explicitly need to write certain things like variable declarations and method calls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Components of the Java Programming Language</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&rsquo;s take a look at how the language of Java is expressed in the code we write. The language itself is a collection of keywords and symbols that we put together to express how we want our code to run. Each line of code has certain rules (or grammar) about how it needs to be constructed and what is or isn&rsquo;t allowed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember, programming languages are&nbsp;<em>abstractions</em>, meaning that they abstract the true underpinnings of how a computer operates into things we can more easily understand. Behind the scenes it really is all ones and zeroes, but we don&rsquo;t need to concern ourselves with that. We can think in these abstract terms to express our ideas and commands, and these abstractions apply across all different types of programming.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basic Data Types</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If programming really is about working with data, then we&rsquo;d better familiarize ourselves with the basic data types used in Java. These are some of the keywords that indicate the type of data we&rsquo;ll use and store in variables.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>
<p><code>int</code>&nbsp;&ndash; An integer value, i.e. a whole number (no decimals) that includes zero and negative numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>float</code>&nbsp;&ndash; A floating point value that includes as many decimal places as it can hold. Because&nbsp;<a title="What Every Computer Scientist Should Know about Floating Point Arithmetic" href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html">the decimal place can change</a>, or float, it&rsquo;s important to know that these values may technically be imprecise. When precise decimals are needed, like for currency, we should use the&nbsp;<a title="BigDecimal API" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html">BigDecimal</a>&nbsp;data type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>boolean</code>&nbsp;&ndash; A 1-bit&nbsp;<em>true</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>false</em>&nbsp;value that can only be in one of those states. The Java keywords for the values are &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;false&rdquo;, which represent 1 and 0, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>char</code>&nbsp;&ndash; A single character, such as the letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; or the symbol &ldquo;#&rdquo;. Note that lowercase and uppercase characters are different, so &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;A&rdquo; are two different characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>String</code>&nbsp;&ndash; String data is a bunch of characters strung together to make text, like a banner strung up at a party.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first four data types in the list above,&nbsp;<code>int</code>,&nbsp;<code>float</code>,&nbsp;<code>boolean</code>, and&nbsp;<code>char</code>, are primitive data types, which means that they are relatively simple and straightforward. Other primitive data types include&nbsp;<code>byte</code>,&nbsp;<code>short</code>, and&nbsp;<code>long</code>. For more information about Java&rsquo;s primitive data types, visit the&nbsp;<a title="Java Primitive Data Types" href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html">documentation from Oracle</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The &ldquo;S&rdquo; in&nbsp;<code>String</code>&nbsp;is capital because&nbsp;<code>String</code>&nbsp;is a more complex data type. Strings are&nbsp;actually objects, and the naming convention in Java is that object names should start with a capital letter. An object is different than a primitive data type because it has more complex properties and methods available to it, whereas the primitive data types are limited and straightforward. For example, the&nbsp;<code>String</code>object has a method called&nbsp;<code>length()</code>&nbsp;that tells us how many characters are in the&nbsp;<code>String</code>, but&nbsp;the&nbsp;<code>int</code>&nbsp;data type does not have any methods like that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Variables</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A variable is basically a container used to hold data. The data itself can be anything from a simple number to coordinates for a location on a map to a URL for a video on the web.&nbsp;As we just learned, Java is a statically-typed language, which means that we need to explicitly declare what type of data a variable is supposed to hold. Let&rsquo;s take a look at an example.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://3wga6448744j404mpt11pbx4-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/variable.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20527" title="Java variable syntax" src="https://3wga6448744j404mpt11pbx4-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/variable.png" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" srcset="https://3wga6448744j404mpt11pbx4-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/variable.png 760w, https://3wga6448744j404mpt11pbx4-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/variable-300x39.png 300w, https://3wga6448744j404mpt11pbx4-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/variable-500x65.png 500w" alt="String title = &quot;Java Basics for Android&quot;;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The line above is a&nbsp;<em>statement</em>&nbsp;that declares a variable named &ldquo;title&rdquo; that holds String, or text, data. It also assigns the text &ldquo;Java Basics for Android&rdquo; to the variable. Let&rsquo;s examine each numbered part:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>
<p>The first word in a variable declaration is the data type, which tells us what kind of data the variable will hold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second word is the name of the variable, which can be anything you want following a few basic rules. Variable names must not contain any spaces or special characters; they can only have letters, numbers, and underscores. They must not start with a number, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The equals sign (=) is an&nbsp;<em>operator</em>, meaning it performs a specific operation for us. This is the&nbsp;<em>assignment</em>&nbsp;operator, meaning that we use it to assign values to variables. In this example it is assigning the text value on the right (#4) to the variable &ldquo;title&rdquo; on the left (#2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The text in green is the String value we are working with. In Java, Strings are surrounded with double quotes to differentiate them from regular text used in the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the last character in this line is the semicolon, which is used to finish this statement. Semicolons in Java are like periods in sentences: we use them to indicate when we&rsquo;re done saying something. Every statement in Java must end with a semicolon (note that a statement may be displayed on multiple lines for better readability).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some other examples of variable declarations using some of the basic data types we covered are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">int playerNumber = 24; float distance = 11.72011f; boolean isEmpty = true; char firstLetterOfName = 'B';</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note the &ldquo;f&rdquo; at the end of the float value that indicates the number is a floating-point value.&nbsp;Also note that&nbsp;<code>char</code>&nbsp;values are surrounded with single quotes to differentiate them from&nbsp;<code>String</code>&nbsp;values, which use double quotes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Methods</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A method is a section of code that we can call from elsewhere in our code, and the method will perform some action or return some kind of result that we can use. Methods are used to organize our code into reusable (and understandable) chunks that save us a lot of time and energy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&rsquo;s use a simplified example of the&nbsp;<code>length()</code>&nbsp;method mentioned above for the&nbsp;<code>String</code>&nbsp;data type to see how a method is defined and called and how it helps us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">01 public int length() { 02 int numberOfCharacters = 0; 03 ... code to calculate the number of characters ... 04 return numberOfCharacters; 05 }</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Line 1 declares the method named&nbsp;<code>length</code>. The first word declares the&nbsp;<em>visibility</em>&nbsp;of the method and is often either&nbsp;<code>public</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>private</code>&nbsp;(though a few other options are available). &ldquo;Public&rdquo; means that it&rsquo;s publicly available to call from anywhere in our app. &ldquo;Private&rdquo; methods are only available within the class they are defined in (more on classes in little bit).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second word in the method is the data type that will be returned. In this case the method will return a number, or&nbsp;<code>int</code>. If the method will run some code but not return any kind of data, then the keyword&nbsp;<code>void</code>&nbsp;is used instead of a data type.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next up is the name of the method. Method names follow roughly the same rules as variable names: letters, numbers, and underscores, but they cannot start with a number.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Directly after the name we see two parenthesis with nothing in between them. The parenthesis are required, but when empty like this it means we do not pass any data or variables when we call the method. If one or more variables (with data types) were included between the parenthesis, then we would need to pass in appropriate values or variables inside the parenthesis when we call this method.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Line 1 ends with an opening curly brace, and a matching closing curly brace is on line 5. In Java, blocks of code, like the code that make up a method, are often surrounded by curly braces to designate all the code that should be run. In this case it means that all the lines of code between the curly braces will be run each time we call the&nbsp;<code>length()</code>&nbsp;method.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The last thing I want to mention from this example is the code on line 4. The&nbsp;<code>return</code>&nbsp;keyword designates that the variable (or data) on the line after the&nbsp;<code>return</code>keyword is what will be returned to whoever called this function. In this example we&rsquo;ve calculated the total number of characters that make up the text of the String and stored the value in an&nbsp;<code>int</code>&nbsp;variable named&nbsp;<code>numberOfCharacters</code>. This variable is returned, meaning that the actual number stored in the variable will be the return value of the&nbsp;<code>length()</code>&nbsp;method.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Calling a Method</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To use a method, we need to call it from our code and, if it returns a value, store the return value somewhere. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s an example of calling the&nbsp;<code>length()</code>&nbsp;method:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">String sampleText = "Java is fun"; int textLength = sampleText.length();</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First we have a String value that has 11 characters (because white space is included). We call the method on the next line using&nbsp;<em>dot notation</em>, which uses a period after a Class or variable name to call the method from. We can&rsquo;t just call it like&nbsp;<code>int textLength = length();</code>&nbsp;because in this incorrect example, there is no point of reference for where the&nbsp;<code>length()</code>&nbsp;method is defined or what text it should be checking. By chaining it to the&nbsp;<code>sampleText</code>&nbsp;String variable, we are saying to use the&nbsp;<code>length()</code>&nbsp;method defined by the&nbsp;<code>String</code>&nbsp;class, and to use it on the text data held in the&nbsp;<code>sampleText</code>&nbsp;variable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this case the&nbsp;<code>length()</code>&nbsp;method calculates a value of 11 and returns it to this code where it was called from. We do something with the return value by storing it in a new int variable named&nbsp;<code>textLength</code>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Major Benefit of Using Methods</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine that we have five different String variables that we need to know the lengths of. If we didn&rsquo;t have a&nbsp;<code>length()</code>&nbsp;method to use, we&rsquo;d have to write the code to calculate the length five different times. But be creating a reusable method, now we only need one line of code each time we want to determine the length of a String value. Programming is all about efficiency, so use methods whenever possible to organize your code and save yourself work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Strings</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Strings are an important part of any programming language including Java. Unlike&nbsp;<em>int</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>boolean</em>, a string isn&rsquo;t a primitive type it is a class. When you create a string variable you are really creating a String object (notice the capital letter S). As an object it has certain properties like its value (the string itself) and its length. Strings can be manipulated in lots of different ways, including being dissected, concatenated, compared, and searched.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is an example program that performs a few simple operations on a String:</p>
<p class="aa_hljs_description clearfix" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="aa_lang_name">JAVA</span><a class="aa_clipboard" data-clipboard-target="#hl_16551">SELECT ALL</a></p>
<p id="hl_16551" class="java hljs" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">PlayingWithStrings</span> </span>{ <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">main</span><span class="hljs-params">(String[] args)</span> </span>{ String hello = <span class="hljs-string">"Hello, World"</span>; System.out.println(hello); <span class="hljs-comment">// Add an ! to the end</span> hello = hello + <span class="hljs-string">"!"</span>; System.out.println(hello); <span class="hljs-comment">// Extract the word "Hello" from the String</span> <span class="hljs-comment">// i.e. starting at the beginning (0) for 5 characters</span> String justHello = hello.substring(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">5</span>); System.out.println(justHello); <span class="hljs-comment">// Add some trailing spaces and then remove them with trim()</span> hello = hello + <span class="hljs-string">" "</span>; hello = hello.trim(); <span class="hljs-comment">// Now output the string all in UPPERCASE and lowercase</span> System.out.println(hello.toUpperCase()); System.out.println(hello.toLowerCase()); } }</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Compile and run it as&nbsp;shown previously.</p>
<p>This is a special method called a constructor. The constructor is called only once, at the moment that the object is created.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first part of the program creates a String object called &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and gives it a value of &ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo;. Although this make look similar to how you declare and assign an integer or another primitive type, actually there is a lot more going on here. Java allows simple operators like = and + to be assigned simple tasks. So really&nbsp;<em>String hello = &ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo;;</em>is actually some like&nbsp;<em>String hello = new String(&ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo;);</em>, in other words, create a new object of type String and pass in the value &ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo; to the constructor. But we will talk more about that in the Objects section below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next part shows how you can concatenate strings, in this case an exclamation point is added to the end of the string. Since String is an object it can have methods.&nbsp;<em>String.substring()</em>&nbsp;is a method which returns part of a string. In this case the first 5 characters.&nbsp;<em>String.trim()</em>&nbsp;is another method which removes leading and trailing spaces. The last part of the program demonstrates the&nbsp;<em>String.toUpperCase()</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>String.toLowerCase()</em>&nbsp;methods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The output from the program will be:</p>
<p class="aa_hljs_description clearfix" style="text-align: justify;"><a class="aa_clipboard" data-clipboard-target="#hl_52401">SELECT ALL</a></p>
<p id="hl_52401" class="hljs" style="text-align: justify;">Hello, World Hello, World! Hello HELLO, WORLD! hello, world!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can find out more about the String object in&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/strings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oracle&rsquo;s String tutorial</a>&nbsp;and from the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Java String documentation</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Loops</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is one thing a computer is good at, it is doing repetitive tasks. To perform a repetitive task in a programming language you use a construct called a loop &ndash; something that loops around again and again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Java has three types of simple loop: the&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;loop, the&nbsp;<em>while</em>&nbsp;loop, and the&nbsp;<em>do while</em>&nbsp;loop. Each loop type follows the same basic idea, you need to repeat something over and over again until a certain condition is met.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is an example which shows how to print out the numbers 1 to 10, 11 to 20, and 21 to 30, using the three different types of loop:</p>
<p class="aa_hljs_description clearfix" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="aa_lang_name">JAVA</span><a class="aa_clipboard" data-clipboard-target="#hl_18411">SELECT ALL</a></p>
<p id="hl_18411" class="java hljs" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Loops</span> </span>{ <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">main</span><span class="hljs-params">(String[] args)</span> </span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">// For loop</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i=<span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i&lt;=<span class="hljs-number">10</span>; i++) { System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"i is: "</span> + i); } <span class="hljs-comment">// While Loop</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> j = <span class="hljs-number">11</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(j&lt;=<span class="hljs-number">20</span>) { System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"j is: "</span> + j); j++; } <span class="hljs-comment">// Do While Loop </span> <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> x = <span class="hljs-number">21</span>; do { System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"x is: "</span> + x); x++; } <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (x &lt;=<span class="hljs-number">30</span>); } }</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Create a file called Loops.java with the code from above, then compile it and run as shown previously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;loop as three parts. First the initialization (<em>int i=1</em>), which is executed only once. In the example above the initialization is used to declare an integer&nbsp;<em>i</em>&nbsp;and set its value to 1. Then comes the test expression (<em>i&lt;=10</em>). This expression will be tested every time the loop executes. If the result of the test is true then the loop will go around again. In this example the test is to check that i is still less than or equal to 10. After each iteration the third section, the iterator, will be executed. In this example it increases the value of&nbsp;<em>i</em>&nbsp;by one. Note that&nbsp;<em>i = i + 1</em>&nbsp;is the same as&nbsp;<em>i++</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The&nbsp;<em>while</em>&nbsp;loop is similar to the&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;loop, except it doesn&rsquo;t contain the initialization phase and the iterator phase. That means that the initialization needs to be done separately, hence the declaration&nbsp;<em>int j = 11;</em>. The iterator also needs to be coded separately. In our example it is the line&nbsp;<em>j++</em>&nbsp;which is found inside the loop after the&nbsp;<em>println()</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A&nbsp;<em>do&hellip; while</em>&nbsp;loop is very similar to a&nbsp;<em>while</em>&nbsp;loop with one big difference, the test to see if the loop should continue is at the end of the loop and not at the start. This means that a&nbsp;<em>do&hellip; while</em>&nbsp;is guaranteed to execute at least once, but a&nbsp;<em>while</em>&nbsp;loop doesn&rsquo;t even need to execute at all, if the conditions aren&rsquo;t met on the entrance into the loop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the&nbsp;<em>while</em>&nbsp;loop, the initialization needs to happen outside the loop, in this case:&nbsp;<em>int x = 21;</em>&nbsp;and the iterator occurs inside the loop:&nbsp;<em>x++</em>. When&nbsp;<em>x</em>&nbsp;goes over 30 the loop will stop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Objects</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I mentioned before in this Java tutorial for beginners, Java is what is known as an object-orientated (OO) programming language and to really learn Java programming and Android programming it is important to understand OO concepts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At its simplest level an object is a set of methods (functions) that work on a data set. The data and the methods belong to the object, and work for the object.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is the source code for a very simple program which creates a&nbsp;<em>counter</em>&nbsp;object:</p>
<p class="aa_hljs_description clearfix" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="aa_lang_name">JAVA</span><a class="aa_clipboard" data-clipboard-target="#hl_61021">SELECT ALL</a></p>
<p id="hl_61021" class="java hljs" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Counter</span> </span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> count; <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-title">Counter</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{ count = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; } <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">Increment</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{ count++; } <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">GetCount</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> count; } <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">main</span><span class="hljs-params">(String[] args)</span> </span>{ Counter myCounter = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Counter(); System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"mycounter is "</span> + myCounter.GetCount()); myCounter.Increment(); System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"mycounter is "</span> + myCounter.GetCount()); } }</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Counter object has one piece of data, the integer variable&nbsp;<em>count</em>&nbsp;and three methods (other than main):&nbsp;<em>Counter(), Increment(), and GetCount()</em>. Leaving the first method for the moment, you can see that&nbsp;<em>Increment()</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>GetCount()</em>&nbsp;are very simple. The first adds one to the internal variable&nbsp;<em>count</em>&nbsp;and the second returns the value of&nbsp;<em>count</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until now all the methods we have declared started with&nbsp;<em>public void</em>&nbsp;but if you notice the&nbsp;<em>GetCount</em><em>()</em>method starts with&nbsp;<em>public int</em>. We will talk more about&nbsp;<em>public</em>&nbsp;in a moment, but the difference between&nbsp;<em>void</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>int</em>&nbsp;is this:&nbsp;<em>void</em>&nbsp;declares that the method doesn&rsquo;t return anything, there will be no result coming back out of the method. But&nbsp;<em>int</em>&nbsp;tells us that the method will return a number, specifically an integer. You can actually create methods that will return all kinds of data, including objects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notice that the first method has the same name as the class itself, i.e.&nbsp;<em>Counter()</em>, and it doesn&rsquo;t have a return type (not even&nbsp;<em>void</em>). This is a special method called a constructor. The constructor is called only once, at the moment that the object is created. It is used to initialize the object with default values and perform any other necessary initialization tasks. In this example it just sets&nbsp;<em>count</em>&nbsp;to zero.</p>
