<h2 class="h2" style="text-align: justify;">Python Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Python</strong>&nbsp;is a general purpose, dynamic, high level, and interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Python is&nbsp;<em>easy to learn</em>&nbsp;yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Python's syntax and&nbsp;<em>dynamic typing</em>&nbsp;with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Python supports&nbsp;<em>multiple programming pattern</em>, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. That is why it is known as&nbsp;<em>multipurpose</em>programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is&nbsp;<em>dynamically typed</em>&nbsp;so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Python makes the development and debugging&nbsp;<em>fast</em>&nbsp;because there is no compilation step included in Python development, and edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.</p>
<h2 class="h2" style="text-align: justify;">Python 2 vs. Python 3</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In most of the programming languages, whenever a new version releases, it supports the features and syntax of the existing version of the language, therefore, it is easier for the projects to switch in the newer version. However, in the case of Python, the two versions Python 2 and Python 3 are very much different from each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A list of differences between Python 2 and Python 3 are given below:</p>
<ol class="points" style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Python 2 uses&nbsp;<strong>print</strong>&nbsp;as a statement and used as print "something" to print some string on the console. On the other hand, Python 3 uses&nbsp;<strong>print</strong>&nbsp;as a function and used as print("something") to print something on the console.</li>
<li>Python 2 uses the function raw_input() to accept the user's input. It returns the string representing the value, which is typed by the user. To convert it into the integer, we need to use the int() function in Python. On the other hand, Python 3 uses input() function which automatically interpreted the type of input entered by the user. However, we can cast this value to any type by using primitive functions (int(), str(), etc.).</li>
<li>In Python 2, the implicit string type is ASCII, whereas, in Python 3, the implicit string type is Unicode.</li>
<li>Python 3 doesn't contain the xrange() function of Python 2. The xrange() is the variant of range() function which returns a xrange object that works similar to Java iterator. The range() returns a list for example the function range(0,3) contains 0, 1, 2.</li>
<li>There is also a small change made in Exception handling in Python 3. It defines a keyword&nbsp;<strong>as</strong>&nbsp;which is necessary to be used. We will discuss it in Exception handling section of Python programming tutorial.</li>

</header>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</p>
