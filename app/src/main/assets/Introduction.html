<h4 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to your guide to Android&trade; app development!&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><br />This book aims to teach the basics of Android app development in Android Studio using Java programming language. I assume that you don?t have any Java&reg; or Android</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">programming experience at the start of this book. I am going to explain every bit of app development in simple terms. You?ll start from scratch and will be able to convert</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">your ideas to your own apps after completing this book. A single book obviously cannot make you the best expert on a platform or programming language however you?ll</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">have a solid background and hands-on experience on Android app development with this book.&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><br />Android apps had been developed using Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) with Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin in the past. However, Google</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">introduced Android Studio as the official IDE for Android app development in 2014 and this IDE became the standard. The latest stable release is Android Studio 2.2, which will be used in this book.&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><br />Let?s overview the fundamentals of Android operating system and the related concepts before starting our programming journey.</h4>
